# tJSON

like the native js JSON object, it provides the two methods strigify and parse.
This lib is just like CircularJSON, but I guarantee the shortest possible JSON, that allow the same reproduction of your objects; 

## Installation
In browser you load it how ever you want. for example as tag before you use it: <script src="tXml.js"></script>.

In node, run **"npm install tjson"** in your project. if necessary with **--save** parameter.
and then in your script you require it by "var tXml = require('tjson');"
